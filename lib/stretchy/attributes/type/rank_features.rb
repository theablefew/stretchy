module Stretchy::Attributes::Type
  # Public: Defines a rank_features attribute for the model.
  #
  # A rank_features field can index numeric feature vectors, so that they can later be used to boost documents in queries with a rank_feature query.

  # It is analogous to the rank_feature data type but is better suited when the list of features is sparse so that it wouldnâ€™t be reasonable to add one field to the mappings for each of them.
  # opts - The Hash options used to refine the attribute (default: {}):
  #        :positive_score_impact - The Boolean indicating if features correlate positively with the score. If set to false, the score decreases with the value of the feature instead of increasing. Defaults to true.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   class MyModel < Stretchy::Record
  #     attribute :negative_reviews, :rank_features, positive_score_impact: false
  #   end
  #
  # Returns nothing.
