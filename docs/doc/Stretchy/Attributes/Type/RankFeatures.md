# Stretchy::Attributes::Type::RankFeatures [](#class-Stretchy::Attributes::Type::RankFeatures) [](#top)
The RankFeatures attribute type

This class is used to define a rank_features attribute for a model. It provides support for the Elasticsearch rank_features data type, which is a type of data type that can index numeric feature vectors, so that they can later be used to boost documents in queries with a rank_feature query. It is better suited when the list of features is sparse so that it wouldnâ€™t be reasonable to add one field to the mappings for each of them.

### Parameters

- `type:` `:rank_features`.
- `options:` The Hash of options for the attribute.
   - `:positive_score_impact:` The Boolean indicating if features correlate positively with the score. If set to false, the score decreases with the value of the feature instead of increasing. Defaults to true.

### Examples

```ruby
  class MyModel < StretchyModel
    attribute :negative_reviews, :rank_features, positive_score_impact: false
  end
```
